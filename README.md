This repo is comprised of very small personal projects.

1. Bingo Seed
    - Returns a 5 x 5 array representing a bingo board, where the middle most "square" is labeled for a free space
    - Requires a list of ideally 24 unique items, to avoid repeats on your board; or you can utilize the default
      generator to create a BINGO board with the standard number fill.
